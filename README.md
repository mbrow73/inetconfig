#  GCP Firewall Policy Automation: Executive Summary

---

##  Agile, Secure Change Management:
Developers request firewall rule changes via a standardized GitHub Issue form.  
Routine access rules are processed automaticallyâ€”speeding up approvals and reducing manual effort.

---

## ðŸ›  Split Management Plane:

- **Self-Service Rules:**  
  Standard requests flow through automation, with validation and NetSec review via Pull Request.

- **Manual NetSec Rules:**  
  Sensitive or complex rules are managed exclusively by NetSec in a separate, controlled config file.

- **Unified Deployment:**  
  Both automated and manual rules are deployed together for complete policy coverage, with clear traceability.

---

##  End-to-End Auditability:
Every request, validation, and change is fully tracked through Issues, PRs, and code commitsâ€”enabling robust compliance and review.

---

##  Instant Feedback:
Validation errors are immediately communicated back to requestors, and issues are closed if requirements are not met, ensuring clean, actionable pipelines.

---

##  Ready for Rapid Approvals:
Approved PRs can be automatically merged and applied, minimizing turnaround for standard requests while preserving NetSec control for critical changes.

---

##  Result:
A modern, auditable, and scalable firewall automation platformâ€”giving the business agility while maintaining NetSec oversight and governance.
