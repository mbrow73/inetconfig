Executive Summary & Architecture Overview
=========================================

Executive Summary
-----------------

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, emphasizing how trust and secure communication are established across all components. The design leverages a robust **chain of trust** model and end-to-end encryption to ensure that only authorized parties can participate in the system. By using industry-standard security mechanisms (X.509 certificates, TLS encryption, etc.), the architecture achieves both strong security and interoperability with existing technologies.

In essence, every client device and service in this architecture is cryptographically verified. When a client connects to a service, each side validates the other's credentials against a common trust anchor. This approach mitigates the risk of unauthorized access or man-in-the-middle attacks by requiring mutual authentication. Additionally, all data in transit is encrypted, protecting sensitive information from eavesdropping or tampering.

The following sections break down the core security concepts and interactions in the system: first explaining the **Chain of Trust** that underpins identity verification, and then detailing the step-by-step **Traffic Flow** of communications. A concise **TL;DR** summary is provided at the end for quick reference.

Chain of Trust
--------------

A **chain of trust** forms the foundation of the system’s security. It refers to the hierarchical linkage of digital certificates that allows any entity in the system to verify the legitimacy of another’s credentials. By definition, _“a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an SSL/TLS Certificate and Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates, that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all CA's are trustworthy”_​[knowledge.digicert.com](https://knowledge.digicert.com/solution/how-certificate-chains-work#:~:text=,next certificate in the chain). In other words, each certificate in the chain is signed by the next higher authority, and this sequence continues until it reaches a **root Certificate Authority (CA)**. The root CA is a special, self-signed certificate which serves as the ultimate **trust anchor** for all identities in the system​[knowledge.digicert.com](https://knowledge.digicert.com/solution/how-certificate-chains-work#:~:text=What is the Root CA,Certificate).

In our architecture, we establish a private Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with a clearly defined certificate hierarchy. A company-controlled **Root CA** issues an **Intermediate CA** certificate, which in turn signs the certificates for all services and client devices. Both clients and servers are configured to trust the Root CA (typically by including the root certificate in their trust stores). This means that when a client presents its certificate to a server, the server can cryptographically verify it was issued by our Intermediate CA (and thus ultimately by our trusted Root). Likewise, the client can verify the server’s certificate in the same manner. If any certificate in the chain is not properly signed by its expected issuer or has been tampered with, the chain-of-trust is broken and the connection will be rejected.

The diagram below illustrates the certificate hierarchy (chain of trust) in this system:

As shown above, the **Root CA** signs the **Intermediate CA** certificate, and the Intermediate CA signs the certificates used by the **Service** and **Client**. This hierarchy ensures that any certificate presented by a client or service can be traced back to the trusted root. Every component thus implicitly trusts the root (and by extension, any certificate signed by the root or its intermediaries). Through this chain-of-trust mechanism, the system achieves mutual trust: a client and server can confidently authenticate each other’s identity before any data is exchanged.

Traffic Flow
------------

Having established the chain of trust, this section describes the step-by-step **traffic flow** when a client device communicates with a service. The process below outlines how a secure session is initiated and how data flows, leveraging the trust model and encryption:

1.  **Client Initiates Connection:** A client device attempts to connect to the protected service endpoint. It begins a TLS handshake, indicating a request to establish a secure session with the server.
    
2.  **Server Presents Certificate:** The service (server) responds by presenting its X.509 SSL/TLS server certificate to the client as part of the TLS handshake. This certificate is part of the chain signed by the trusted CA.
    
3.  **Client Verifies Server Identity:** The client uses its built-in trust store (which contains the Root CA certificate) to verify the server’s certificate. It checks that the certificate was indeed issued by the trusted CA chain and is not expired or revoked. If the verification fails, the connection is terminated; if it succeeds, the server’s identity is confirmed.
    
4.  **Client Sends Certificate (Mutual TLS):** Next, the client optionally presents its own certificate to the server (this step occurs if **mutual TLS** authentication is enabled, as is the case in our design to authenticate clients). The client’s certificate was also issued by the Intermediate CA in the trust chain.
    
5.  **Server Verifies Client Identity:** The server validates the client’s certificate against the same Root CA trust anchor. It ensures the certificate is signed by the Intermediate CA (and thus ultimately by the Root CA) and checks the certificate’s validity (authenticity and expiration status). If this check fails, the server refuses the connection. If it succeeds, the server now trusts the client’s identity.
    
6.  **Secure Channel Established:** With both identities verified, the TLS handshake completes. A symmetric encryption key is negotiated between client and server, establishing an encrypted channel. At this point, a secure **mutual TLS** session is in place, meaning both parties are authenticated and all further communication will be encrypted.
    
7.  **Request Transmission:** The client sends its actual request (for example, an API call or data query) over the TLS-secured channel. The content of the request is encrypted in transit.
    
8.  **Service Processes Request:** The server receives the encrypted request, decrypts it, and processes it. The server may perform any application-level logic needed (such as reading or writing to a database or invoking other internal services), leveraging the fact that the client's identity is verified (for instance, for authorization decisions).
    
9.  **Response Sent Securely:** The server then sends back a response to the client over the same TLS connection. Because the channel is encrypted and authenticated, the client can be sure the response indeed came from the legitimate server and that the contents weren’t altered in transit.
    

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the above interaction between the client and server during the connection setup and request/response exchange:

Through this flow, the system ensures that both parties are authenticated via the chain of trust **before** any sensitive data is exchanged. Every message between client and server is encrypted, and each step relies on previously established trust. This end-to-end process guarantees data confidentiality and integrity while providing a seamless experience for the client.

TL;DR
-----

*   **Trusted PKI Hierarchy:** The architecture relies on a private PKI with a root Certificate Authority as the trust anchor. All client and server certificates are issued under this hierarchy, forming a clear chain of trust.
    
*   **Mutual Authentication:** Clients and servers authenticate each other using their digital certificates (mutual TLS), ensuring that only trusted entities can communicate on the network.
    
*   **Encrypted Communication:** All data exchanges occur over TLS-encrypted channels. This means information remains confidential and cannot be read or modified in transit by unauthorized parties.
    
*   **Secure Flow Enforcement:** The connection process is designed to halt if trust cannot be established. Any certificate that is invalid or not signed by the trusted CA will result in the connection being refused, protecting the system from imposters.
    

In summary, when a client connects to the service, both sides verify each other’s identities using certificates issued by a common trusted authority. Once this verification succeeds, they establish an encrypted session and proceed with data exchange. This approach ensures that every interaction in the system is both authenticated and secure, aligning with our organization’s security requirements and providing confidence to stakeholders that data and services are well-protected.
